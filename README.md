Facebook-OAuth-Provider
======================

ASP.NET MVC 5 Web apps that use ASP.NET Identity 2.0 with OWIN as described at 
http://www.asp.net/identity can use Facebook for user identity and sign in.

The difference between this library and the Facebook OAuth provider shipped with the OWIN/Katana middleware is that it supports more Facebook-specific parameters.

This library was originally developed for and is in use at https://freebusy.io

This library is available as a NuGet package at https://www.nuget.org/packages/Owin.Security.Providers.Facebook
